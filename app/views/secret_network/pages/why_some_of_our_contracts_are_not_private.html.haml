                    After a lot of research and discussion, we've decided to make our DEFI smart contracts transparent. We did this to increase trust and reduce corruption.
                    %b For your own safety, we recommend that you assume ALL interactions, on chain, can be linked to your account.

                  %h5 An example of how you can be linked to an account
                  %p Your account has interacted with a centralized exchange you have provided identification to.

                  %p In the example above, a user has created an account on Binance, provided identification, and then sent SCRT to their account.

                  %h5 Some examples of how your account can be linked to a smart contract
                  %p 1. Your account directly interacts with a smart contract.

                  %p 2. You transfer tokens to a contract and someone has access to the viewing key for that contract.
                  = image_tag 'https://siasky.net/OACFVwKZnregKQFEyaes1DCc_6JugAOZFUQcy1u5ZA5SNQ'

                  %p 3. You send tokens to a contract, which changes something that is viewable. An example would be if you deposited a token into an earn contract, and the contract's balance went up.

                  %h5 How to maintain privacy
                  %p You can maintain privacy by obtaining an account that can't be linked to you. You can do this by using a privacy coin such as Monero, and an exchange that does not require identification. In the example below, a user buys SCRT from Binance, creates two Monero accounts, swaps the SCRT for Monero via SimpleSwap.io and has the Monero sent to account #1, sends the Monero from account #1 to #2, creates a Secret network account, then swaps the Monero to SCRT through SimpleSwap.io and has it sent to their Secret network account.
