      %h5 The team
      %p Currenly button is a one man team, Steven Chang from Sydney, Australia. Formerly the CTO of fundraising platform EZ raise, I decided to go full time crypto during the 2020 covid lockdowns. I used crypto here and there before covid, but seeing the recent crazy money printing and censorship going on, I thought the best thing I can do to empower the most important class of people, the middle class, is to work on block chain technologies.

      %h5 The tech stack
      %p Ruby on rails for the app. Rust smart contracts on the Secret Network.

      %h5 Keep it simple
      %p Write very simple, easy to understand smart contracts: I had money in the vbSWAP stake pool when their stake contract got exploited. What's funny is that I did a code review for AutoFarm, Beefi and Value, and thought that Value was the most high tech. One thing I thought though while I was reviewing the value contracts was that it was very complex, a single staking pool required a vault contract, a controller contract, several farming strategy conctracts, a vault master contract and then the actual third party contract. On top of that there were several different roles, a deployer, a timelock contract, a strategist etc etc.

      %p All this is great, but with complexity comes, a bigger chance for error. As a developer myself, I can feel the pressure the devs are under. Simplicity is key.

      %h5 Build in insurance
      %p One thing that value exploit taught me was to build in a reserve fund. Accidents, hacks and theft happens. I was so impressed that the value team had a reserve fund to give us some of our money back and then came up with a really quick minting and burning plan to reimburse people. Some people suggest that it's DEFI and you should expect to lose it all in a hack, I don't agree. Just because finance is decentralized, doesn't mean the community and the devs can't agree on and build in a reserve fund tax.
